# Proxy Mode

PMG supports an experimental proxy based interception as an alternative to the current optimistic dependency resolution. When enabled via `--experimental-proxy-mode` flag:

- PMG starts a micro-proxy server on a random localhost port
- Runs `npm` and other supported package managers configured to use the proxy
- Intercepts package registry requests and analyzes packages as they are downloaded
- Blocks malicious packages and allows trusted packages to be installed

## Usage

```bash
pmg --experimental-proxy-mode npm install lodash
```

## Configuration

To permanently enable proxy mode, add the following to your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
experimental_proxy_mode: true
```
