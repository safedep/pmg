# Package Manager Guard (PMG)
🤖 PMG protects developers from getting compromised by malicious packages.
See [example](https://safedep.io/malicious-npm-package-express-cookie-parser/)

- Wraps your favorite package manager (eg. `npm`)
- Blocks malicious packages at install time
- No configuration required, just install and use

## 📦 TL;DR

Install `pmg`

```shell
brew install safedep/tap/pmg
```

Set up `pmg` to protect you development environment from malicious packages:

```
echo "alias npm='pmg npm'" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "alias pnpm='pmg pnpm'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Continue using your favorite package manager as usual:

```shell
npm install <package-name>
```

```shell
pnpm add <package-name>
```

## Installation

### Binaries

Download the latest binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/safedep/pmg/releases).

### Build from Source

> Ensure $(go env GOPATH)/bin is in your $PATH

```bash
go install github.com/safedep/pmg@latest
```

## Usage

Install a package with `npm` or `pnpm`:

```bash
pmg npm install <package-name>
pmg pnpm add <package-name>
```

Set shell alias for convenience:

```bash
alias npm="pmg npm"
alias pnpm="pmg pnpm"
```

Continue using your favorite package manager as usual:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

```bash
pnpm add <package-name>
```

### Silent Mode

Use the `--silent` flag to run PMG in silent mode:

```bash
pmg --silent npm install <package-name>
```

### Verbose Mode

Use the `--verbose` flag to run PMG in verbose mode:

```bash
pmg --verbose npm install <package-name>
```

### Debugging

Use the `--debug` flag to enable debug mode:

```bash
pmg --debug npm install <package-name>
```

Store the debug logs in a file:

```bash
pmg --debug --log /tmp/debug.json npm install <package-name>
```

## 🚫 Limitations

<details>
<summary>Approximate dependency version resolution</summary>

`pmg` resolves the transitive dependencies of a package to be installed. It does it by querying
package registry APIs such as `npmjs` and `pypi`. However, almost always, dependency versions are
specified as ranges instead of specific version. Different package managers have different ways of
resolving these ranges. It also depends on peer or host dependencies already available in the application.

`pmg` is required to block a malicious package *before* it is installed. Hence it applies its own heuristic
to choose a version from a version range for evaluation. This is fine when all versions of a given package
is malicious. However, there is a possibility of inconsistency when a specific version of a package is malicious.
